# CIVL6059 Assembly control of prefabricated modules with a Robotic Arm

Hi, I'm Ruiqi, the teaching assistant of CIVL6059. Welcome to choose this mini-project.

## Brief of this mini-project

#### Aim: To research/develop a kinematic control algorithm for the robotic arm to assemble the prefabricated module to the specified position.

#### Objectives:

1. Master the kinematic and constraints modeling for the industrial robotic arm (Problem description).

2. Attain expertise in an optimization algorithm, e.g., particle swarm optimization or model predictive control (Methodology).

3. Gain proficiency in a robotic arm simulation environment, e.g., Omniverse or Unity (Validation). 

#### Objectives: 

- Introduction, 
- Related research, 
- Methodology, 
- Experimental validation (data analysis and screenshot video).

#### Resources

- Preliminary of robotic kinematic: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics1/home/welcome

- Optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhgDMAm-imI), model predictive control (https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zak/Second_ed/MPC_handout.pdf)

- Certain useful robotic arm sources and simulation codes will updated at this repository.

## Additional resource

It will be updated in recent.
