# CIVL6059 Assembly control of prefabricated modules with a Robotic Arm

Hi, I'm Ruiqi, the teaching assistant of CIVL6059. Welcome to select this mini-project.

## Description of this mini-project

#### Aim: To research/develop a kinematic control algorithm for the robotic arm to assemble the prefabricated module to the specified position.

#### Objectives:

##### Master the kinematic and constraints modeling for the industrial robotic arm (Problem description).

##### Attain expertise in an optimization algorithm, e.g., particle swarm optimization or model predictive control (Methodology).

##### Gain proficiency in robotic arm simulation environment, e.g., Omniverse or Unity (Validation).
